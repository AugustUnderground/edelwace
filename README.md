# EDELWAC²E

Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for
[GAC²E](https://github.com/AugustUnderground/gace) in
[HaskTorch](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch).

## Setup

LibTorch is required, as per HaskTorch Tutorial, and must be symlinked into
this directory. Then source `setenv` in your shell.

For training [OAC²EIS](https://github.com/AugustUnderground/oaceis) must be up
and running.

```bash
$ stack build
$ stack run
```

## Requirements

- hasktorch
- libtorch-ffi
- wreq
- aeson
- hvega
- random-fu

## Algorithms

Focus on Probabilistic and Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms.
